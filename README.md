  ## Installation
  In order to install this project the user must access the GitHub repository and use the code from the command line.
  
  ## Usage
  When accessing the code from the integrated terminal, the command-line prompts for information about the logo by asking the user for 3 characters, the color of the text, the shape of the logo, and the color of the shape. A svg file is generated with the information the user inputs and the logo is able to be viewed from a broswer.
